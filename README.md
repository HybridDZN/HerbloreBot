# Herblore Auto-Clean By xero
An Oldschool Runescape herblore herb cleaning bot written in Python.

Get the herbs out from your bank and run the script to clean the whole inventory of herbs in just 1.12 seconds!
You're going to need to install pynput for this to work.

This script is dependant on screen resolution. It was written with a 1920x1080 screen resolution in mind while using the RuneLite Client.
